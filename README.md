# ft_containers

This project implements various types of containers in the C++ standard template library: 
* [Map](http://cplusplus.com/reference/map/map)
* [List](http://cplusplus.com/reference/list/list)
* [Vector](http://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector)
* [Stack](http://cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack)
* [Queue](http://cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/)

## Usage:
In the "test" folder there are tests to check the proper work for each container. 
Simply run the .sh script you want, e.g.

```bash
bash test_map.sh
```
Tests test the output of the STL library containers and my own implementation of the container.
If case no differences found, there will be the message of SUCCESS.
